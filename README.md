A ReactJs project on the old famous TV show -> "WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE". 
It has a Username entry page for the player to input their name before starting the trivia game. Then at the start, the player has 30 secs to answer each question. Once the player gets the answer correct, they proceed to the next question till the final question. If they pick a wrong answer during the game, they lose and are shown the amount they have earned.
